# CRUD-REACT

## About the application
This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that allows user registration. Users can register with the following information: Name, CPF, Email and Telephone.
The entire project was done in React with Vite, below we teach how to run the project with these technologies and their e2e tests using Cypress.

## Run React.JS with Vite
Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `npx cypress open` to execute cypress. Click on E2E Testing, choose your preferred browser and select the test you want to run.
